# EMNIST-Classification-MLP-vs-CNN
Comparison of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for classifying images from the EMNIST dataset.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that compares the performance of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the EMNIST dataset for handwritten character classification.

## Models Compared
1. **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**: A feed-forward neural network.
2. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**: A deep learning model typically used for image data.
   
## Dataset
The notebook uses the **EMNIST** dataset, which is an extension of the MNIST dataset and contains more classes for both digits and letters.
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset).


## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you need the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
